This project aims to examine how mental health affects different genders, ages, and nationalities differently when working in the tech industry. The reason why we want to explore this topic is so that companies are better aware of who may be marginalized or feeling unsupported in the workplace. This can inform employers on how to become more supportive and inclusive to all so that people are relatively stress-free and mentally healthy. This also helps retain the best employees. Many other studies have been done in the past to prove that working in the tech industry can have a negative effect on mental health, but very few has delved deep into how the effects differ across demographics. I divided each independent variable's groups, converted categorical values into quantitative values and performed EDA/statistical analysis to come up with my findings. And in the end, I found that gender plays a very significant role in affecting mental health, while age and location (country) surprisingly does not. Non-binary employees' mental health are generally most negatively affected by working in the tech industry; thus we hope that employers are mindful of this fact while providing mental health care support.
