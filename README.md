# data-512-final
Final Project

### Proposal
I plan on examining mental health of tech workers around the world (although I have more data points of those in the US). Based on gender and location, how does mental health affect those who work in the tech industry differently? We know the tech industry is very fast-paced; but I want to see how it affects mental health for different demographics.
