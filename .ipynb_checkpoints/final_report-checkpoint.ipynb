    "#### Introduction and Motivation:\n",
    "Given that so many people here in Puget Sound are a part of the tech industry or are interested in joining, I wanted to see how does working in the tech industry affect our mental health. The tech industry is known for being fast paced and harsh in the sense that it expects many deliverables and products on a yearly basis. Additonally, programming for many years can become taxing over time. I want to examine how working a tech job affects the mental health of different demographics. It would be beneficial to see how if affects different people as companies can work to improve mental health of their employees. Also, I'm very curious about the results, as I am also a part of the tech industry. I would like to learn whether a certain gender or country is affected more by mental health while working in a tech job. My main question is how does working in the tech industry affect employee's mental health based on different employee demographics?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background/Related Work:\n",
    "There is actually a lot of great articles and studies done previously examining how working in the tech industry affects mental health. In fact, I wouldn't be able to link them all because it's such a braod and popular topic. But none specifically looks at how mental health could be impacted differently for different types of tech employees. In most of previous articles, the general consensus was that working a fast paced, stressful tech job will lower mental health for everyone. It is almost assumed as a given in these articles. In [Let's Talk: It's Time to Get Serious About Mental Illness in Tech](https://www.iqmetrix.com/blog/lets-talk-its-time-to-get-serious-about-mental-illness-in-tech), the statistics show how founders of tech companies are 2X more likely to suffer depression, 6X more likely to have ADHD, and 3X more likely to have substance abuse. This are some alarming statistics. And it's not just founders, a lot of tech workers suffer in the same way.\n",
    "Simiarily in another article, in [Mental Health Awareness Week - the tech industry crisis that organizations need to tackle](https://diginomica.com/mental-health-awareness-week-tech-industry-crisis-organizations-need-tackle) the article raises up the point that 2/3 of tech workers feel stressed and more than half will experience depression or anxiety at some point.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if we dug into deeper details, and took a look at which tech workers are most affected?\n",
    "The only curiosity that I had, after reading all of these articles, was which demographic of tech workers are most affected in terms of mental health. I plan on examining gender and location as the defining demographic variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data that I will be examining has come from [Open Sourcing Mental Illness](https://osmihelp.org/). They have already conducted a study back in 2014 and individually surveyed tech workers to gather this information. Luckily, they gathered some demographic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Research questions and/or hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Research question: How does working in the tech industry affect different demographics' mental health? \n",
    "- Hypothesis: I think older (>30) women's mental health from countries/states that have a small tech scene will be most negatively affected.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data selected for analysis\n",
    "My data is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey. I believe it is open source, as the author of the dataset is Open Sourcing Mental Illness, LTD. I want to use this because it is fairly comprehensive, has the columns that I need, and doesn't need too much manipulation. It also has some great key columns on demographics, such as age, gender, country, state, whether the employer is considered tech, work interference, benefits, and anonymity. I can group certain categories together and count how many people of a demographic has mental health that affects their work, whether they are willing to share it or not, etc. As the data was obtained through volunteers who completed the mental health survey, there isn' too many ethical concerns on the employees side, but there are some concerns with using the dataset that could affect the employer. Luckily, the employer's company name and supervisors are not shared in this dataset, but there are some columns that could potentially call out employers who have not been caring for mental health in the workplace.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Methodology: \n",
    "I will probably break up the project into four parts.\n",
    "I plan on starting off my analysis with data cleaning because some of the data isn't standardized (free form text left some spelling errors and different forms of writing). Then I would want to do some EDA, then work on statistical analysis, then create some data visualizations. \n",
    "I chose EDA because I think being able to extract the basic statistics would give the reader a good approximate counts of which employees are affected the most. Then I chose statistical analysis in order to verify and confirm the findings from EDA. Finally I think having data visualizations would help the reader to easily see the conclusion along with our findings.\n",

    "The raw data in this dataset is not standardized nor clean. Free form text leads to different spelling or typos that make it hard to group certain responses together, or categorical values make it hard to extract statistics. Additionally, there are some N/A values in this dataset. So, my first step is to clean the raw data so that the gender answers are grouped into male. female, and non-binary. Next I have to convert the categorical work_interfere column into numerical values, remove unrealistic ages (typos), and remove N/As. This reduces my dataset by 270 rows."

I used binary mental health scores to compare all three groups of gender in a chi-squared test.

    "- Based on the statistical analysis, we find that non-binary employees have an average mental health score of 1.82, males have an average of 1.48, and females have an average of 1.73 when they are working in the tech industry. We can see based on these scores that non-binary employees tend to be more severely affected, and men tend to be least affected. Based on the p-value on gender, this is a statistically significant factor in affecting mental health. Otherwise, age and country does not have significant p-values and therefore aren't demographics to really consider when talking about mental health. I was very surprised to learn that age and location did not affect mental health significantly! I would imagine being older would have more stressers, or that some countries have much tougher work cultures. However, I see now that either these were mistakenly assumed, or my dataset is not large enough to make that determination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unknowns and dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "- I kept the scope of the project to just examining which demographics are more heavily impacted by mental health. If I widen the scope to how are tech companies working to fix mental health issues in their workplace, then that would be tougher question and involve more columns of data. So I would have to perform extra EDA and work with the data more before I commit to widening the scope. I ended up using just this daataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Thinking on dependencies, I don't think I have a dependency on any other dataset. However, this brings the concern on if I widen the scope, and need more columns of data, it would be very difficult to find another dataset to append to this one as there are no similar identifying keys/unique IDs. As of now, I don't anticipate using another dataset but if I need to later on, it would be difficult to join it with this dataset. However, I could always use the datasets separately and that would resolve the issue. These would be good points to think about in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Most of the limitations of this project came from the dataset. Some of the data was in free-form text, meaning the survey responders could type in their answer. An example of this is gender. I had to do a lot of cleaning to reorganize the data into three distinguishable buckets. Another limitation of the dataset is that there were only four scores/categories where mental health effect is recorded: never, rarely, sometimes, often. I think the analysis would be more accurate and comprehensive if more categories existed for this variable. The dataset is also fairly small. 1,200 rows to start off is good, but after cleaning and dropping NA values, the dataset dropped to around 990 rows. More rows of data could lead to higher accuracy in the statistical analysis. And combined with the fact that the countries nor genders don't have an even number of responders make it harder to compare results across more countries. Additionally, because the responders come from all over the world, it is quite possible that different nationalities consider level of mental health differently.

    "- The implications of this project is that we now have identified certain demographics that tend to have higher scores or percentages of people whose mental health is affected by their jobs. Based on these findings, we can assume (not stereotype!) that in general, non-binary employees will be most affected by working in the tech field. This implies that they may face more discrimintation or marginalization in the workforce. They may be uncomfortable in the ways coworkers act around them, or companies are not supporting these employees enough to keep their mental health score lower along with the other employees. This is important for companies to know so that they provide the necessary support and guidance for non-binary employees in particular, and to be mindful of what they may face differently in the workforce compared to others. Of course, it is suggested that all employees get mental health support under stress, but companies should be more careful, or maybe be more catered in the way they support non-binary and female employees. Age seems to have very little effect on mental health surprisingly, so there is not much implications here. As for countries, it is simply informative to know that Germany tends to have a slightly higher percentage of workers who feel negatively affected by working in the tech industry. This can imply that they may have a culture of strict standards at work which can increase stress. It is an interesting finding to see which countries can improve their companies' culture to be more accomodating to people's mental health."

    "##### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the analysis, we can conclude that gender does have a statistically significant effect on mental health, while age and location (country) does not. In general, non-binary employees are more severely impacted, and tend to have a worse mental health score, at an average of 1.82. This is approximately the equivalent of many non-binary employees responding \"Sometimes\" to having such severe mental health issues that their work is affected. Companies should adapt their mental support policies to accomodate for this demographic, who may feel marginalized in the workplace."
